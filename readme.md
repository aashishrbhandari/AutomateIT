## Automation

<!---
It all starts with learning and understanding how HTTP works, how API works, how websites interact to the backend to execute a operation like displaying all users etc.I have been learning this from a long and i always try to check how a web application is working what Internal API it is calling and whether it can be automated easily.


How Web Apps Interact
This is important to learn, to be able to automate it.
My Discovery starts with the Problem statement provided by any client, user, colleague, friend or anyone who is doing something manually on an webapp, something that is like following an SOP, doing the same operation again and again where in the only change is the data.I love to go ahead and add my automation skill there to
